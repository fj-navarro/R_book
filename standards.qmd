# Coding Standards for R

-   Always use **text files/text editor**.

-   **Indent** your code. Each indent should be a minimum of 4 spaces, and ideally 8 spaces.

-   **Limit the width** of your code. You can limit the width of your text editor so that the code you write doesn't fly off into the wilderness on the right hand side.

-   **Limit the length** of individual functions. A function should not take up more than one page of your editor (of course, this depends on the size of your monitor).
