# Regression Analysis

**Regression analysis** is a form of predictive modelling techniques that identifies the relationships between dependent and independent variables(s). The technique is used to find causal effect relationships between variables.

**Regression analysis** identifies the significant relationships between dependent and independent variables and the strength of the impact of multiple independent variables on dependent variables.

## Linear Regressions

The linear regression equation is $y = b_0 + b_1 x$, where **y** is the dependent variable, **x** is the independent variable, $b_0$ is the intercept, and $b_1$ is the slope.

To use linear regression in R, you use the `lm()` function:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100, mean=1, sd=1)
y <- rnorm(100, mean=2, sd=2)
data <- data.frame(x, y);
mod <- lm(data$y ~ data$x, data=data)
mod
summary(mod)
```

When the **p-value** is less than 0.05, the model is significant:

-   $H_0$: Coefficient associated with the variable is equal to zero

-   $H_a$: Coefficient is not equal to zero (there is a relationship)

Furthermore:

-   The higher the **R-squared** and the **adjusted R-squared**, the better the linear model.

-   The lower the **standard error**, the better the model

## Multiple Linear Regressions

Multiple linear regression is used when you have more than one independent variable.

The equation of a multiple linear regression is: 

**$y = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + ... + b_ k x_k + ϵ$**

When you have n observations or rows in the data set, you have the following model:

Using a matrix, you can represent the equations as: $y = Xb + ϵ$

To calculate the coefficients: \^b = (X' X)-1 X' y

```{r}
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100, mean=1, sd=1)
x2 <- rnorm(100, mean=2, sd=5)
y <- rnorm(100, mean=2, sd=2)
data <- data.frame(x, x2, y)
mod <- lm(data$y ~ data$x + data$x2, data=data)
mod
summary(mod)
```
